## Welcome 

Julia is THE cool new programming language on the block!

It's fast, dynamic, and easy to use. It's ideal for data science, and a range of other problems.

This group was created by Angus Lewis and Matt Roughan to support the local Julia programming community in South Australia. If anyone else wants to help organise, they would be welcome.

We have fortnightly meetups (Fridays at 11am, at the University of Adelaide) starting on the 19th of Feb, 2021. See the schedule below for exact locations.

If you want to be involved contact Matt Roughan by email (see below) and I'll add you to the Slack channel to join the discussion and find out what's going on.

All with an interest in programming in Julia are welcome. We have people ranging from novices to those who have been playing with Julia since the early days.
